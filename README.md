Website that utilizes National State Park(NPS) API and allows users to peruse parks and make a list of locations that they want to visit with all the information that comes along with them.

The ultimate shopping list for your bucket list

## intended market

outdoorsy people - or those that want to get outside more - instead of being stuck infront of a computer all day...
Our intended market of users for this would be 'weekend warriors' or travelers who are looking to enjoy adventures that are more outdoors oriented - here they are able to look up places of interest and possibly find others who have visited and see their comments on a park. On each page theyre able to check valuable information on a states park such as weather, activities, and amenities. 


* possible ad revenue from vendors - REI/ outdoor retailers/ travel sites/ 
* travelers looking to visit state park areas
* 

## functionality 
** uses NPS API to retrieve data for parks **
** uses Weather API to retrieve weather data for parks **
** Users are those who have created an account ** 

* anyone can create an account
    * users can edit their profile/account
    * add pinned parks to your account - create their 'bucket list' of places they want to/ intend on visiting
    * pinned parks can be 'checked off' after youve made your visit to the park 
    * users will have a history of parks theyve visited/checked off their bucket list 
* search states for parks - to list parks in the state  
    * unlock additional info from parks after login/signing up to encourage users to create an account
    * include weather conditions for parks
* users can leave comments on a park/ park rating system?
* amenities - parking/ restrooms/ food/ camping
* activities to do at the parks
* articles of the park/ info? 

*** achievements - something used to track how many parks a user has visited; at some thresholds users gain medals or accolades
*** social aspect 
*** live feed from area if cam is available - some parks have ranger cameras if we are able to find a way to tap into their feeds we can include these as part of a parks page information (can also make this available for users after signup)

## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
